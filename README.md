Car

You need to create, start and stop a car.

The essence of Car:
– property “name”: the name of the car – String
– method “drive": go – outputs the text “drive” to the console
– method “stop": stop – outputs the text “stop” to the console

An entity means an important semantic object that participates in the task (interface + implementation class, or just a separate class without an interface - but this is not recommended).

Which constructors to create in the class (empty, with parameters) is at your discretion.

An interface for Car must be created so that the code is more extensible and conforms to the principles of OOP (abstraction-implementation)
